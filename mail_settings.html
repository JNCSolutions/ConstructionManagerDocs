    <h4>To, CC and BCC</h4>

    <p>You can add default `cc` and `bcc` addresses for your different types of outgoing mail.</p>

    <h4>Placeholders</h4>

    <p>You can add a personal touch to your email templates with our placeholders. If you want a value from your customer records to appear in your mail body, simply add one of these values to your template where you want it to appear:</p>

    <code><pre>%COMPANY_NAME%       The name of the recipient company
%CONTACT_NAME%       The name of the human listed as the company's main contact</pre></code>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <code><pre>Dear %CONTACT_NAME%,

Attached to this email is the invoice for our recently completed work.

Kind regards,
Joe Bloggs
