    <h3 id="from-spreadsheet">Importing Products from Spreadsheet</h3>

    <p>To import your products from a spreadsheet, click "Import from Spreadsheet". You will be taken to an entry screen where you can manually type in multiple products to import. However, click the "Import" button at the bottom, and you can select a spreadsheet to import your data from.</p>

    <p>After selecting a spreadsheet and clicking "Import", a dialog will open you asking for the following details:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Which rows would you like to upload?</b> By default, the start and stop values contain the entire spreadsheet. Unless you just want to import a subset of the sheet, you should leave these values alone.</li>
      <li><b>Skip first row?</b> If the first row of your spreadsheet contains a text header describing the columns, you should select this to avoid treating the column names as data.</li>
      <li><b>Column assignments.</b> Here you can assign columns from the imported sheet to the expected input fields.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After you've finished with these settings, simply confirm your selection and your data will be imported into the database.</p>

    <p>On the edit product screen, you can set a product as a Text Item or Term. When used on a quote, any cost information will be ignored and it will be printed without prices on the .</p>

    <h3 id="not-automatic">Why are my products out of sync with Sage?</h3>

    <p>Because of the typically large quantities of data stored in the Sage products table, we do not pull this information through automatically. If you have made changes to your Sage data that you wish to be reflected on ConstructionManager.Net, you must perform the import process again. Your products will then be updated with the latest values from Sage.</p>
