    <h3>Importing Products</h3>

    <p>You can add products to Construction Manager one at a time, but the most efficient way of importing multiple products is by using the csv upload function. If you clock `Products` followed by `Import`, you can select a comma separated value (.csv) file to upload.</p>

    <p>After hitting upload, a dialog will open you asking for the following details:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Which rows would you like to upload?</b> By default, the start and stop values contain the entire spreadsheet. Unless you just want to import a subset of the sheet, you should leave these values alone.</li>
      <li><b>Skip first row?</b> If the first row of your spreadsheet contains a text header describing the columns, you should select this to avoid treating the column names as data.</li>
      <li><b>Column assignments.</b> Here you can assign columns from the imported sheet to the expected input fields.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After you've finished with these settings, simply confirm your selection and your data will be imported into the database.</p>
