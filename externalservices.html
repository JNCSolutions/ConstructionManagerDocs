    <h3>Preparing your Network</h3>

    <p>It is important that your firewall and router are properly configured to let traffic from constructionmanager.net through to your MySQL database and Sage integration service.</p>

    <p>Ports <strong>3306</strong> (for MySQL) and <strong>8081</strong> (for the Sage integration service) must be open on your router and forwarded to the correct machine. If that machine has an additional firewall such as Windows Firewall, rules must be set to allow connections to those ports or programs.</p>

    <h3>Connecting to Construction Manager 50</h3>

    <p>Construction Manager currently uses the data that you have stored in your CM50 database.</p>

    <p>You (or your IT department) will need to supply Construction Manager with the  MySQL credentials used by your CM50 software.</p>

    <table class="table">
      <tr>
        <td><b>Hostname</b></td>
        <td>The IP address of the MySQL server.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Username</b></td>
        <td>The username associated with the CM50 account.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Password</b></td>
        <td>The password associated with the CM50 account.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Port</b></td>
        <td> The port that MySQL is listening on (usually <strong>3306</strong>).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Database</b></td>
        <td>The database containing the company data.</td>

    <h3>Connecting to Sage</h3>

    <p>Construction Manager interacts with your sage data by means of a service listening on your network. When installed, this service will run on your server waiting for connections from https://constructionmanager.net</p>

    <p>The Sage integration service can be configured with the provided settings utility. The settings utility allows you to configure the following fields:</p>

    <table class="table">
      <tr>
        <td><b>Sage path</b></td>
        <td>The path to your sage data.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Sage username</b></td>
        <td>The username of your sage user.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Sage password</b></td>
        <td>The password of your sage user.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Service password</b></td>
        <td>This value needs to be set both on the server and the website. The only requirement is that they match, as this is the password used to allow the website to interact with your sage data.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Sage version</b></td>
        <td>The version of the sage SDO version to use.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The Sage integration service listens on port 8081, so it is important that you or your IT ensure that this port is open on your router/firewall. When you're comfortable that the service and router are correctly configured, you can fill in the <strong>Sage Integration Settings</strong> section of your <strong>connection settings</strong> page.</p>

    <p><strong>NB:</strong> If you have filled in your Sage connection details but they are incorrect, you will be prompted to fix it each time the system is accessed.</p>

    <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>The service won't start on my machine</strong>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Check that the appropriate SDO is installed on your server.</li>
        <li>Check the Windows Event Log to see whether the SDO TLB file must be registered.</li>
      </ul>
