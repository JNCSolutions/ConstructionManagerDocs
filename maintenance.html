    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
      <p>The Maintenance module has been designed to provide additional functionality for small maintenance types of work. 
      For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Producing job cards and instructions for workers, optionally via mobile phones</li>
        <li>Tracking job times and status of jobs</li>
        <li>Storing many site addresses which are used repeatedly</li>  
        <li>Different job types, e.g.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Cost plus markup</li>
          <li>Authorised price</li>
          <li>Schedule of rates</li>
          <li>Product invoice</li>
          <li>Quote invoice</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Automating sales invoicing, e.g.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Preview list of jobs to invoice</li>
          <li>One invoice per job</li>
          <li>Many jobs on one invoice</li>
        </ul
      </ul>
      </ul>
      <br>
      
      <h3 id="maintenance-jobs">Maintenance Jobs</h3>
      <p>To access Maintenance, select the Maintenance>Maintenance Jobs tab on the main menu. 
          This will open the following screen:</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_List_01.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>This displays a list of all maintenance jobs on your system. 
          The list can be manipulated in the usual way - see <a href="Manipulating Lists.html">Manipulating Lists.</a>.</p>
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="new-mjob">New Maintenance Job</h4>
      <p>To create a new job, click on the <b>New</b> button. 
          This will open the following screen, under the details>job information tab:.
          This data is used by the office, rather than the on-site engineer.</p>
      <p><b>N.B.</b> Jobs are also often created from the <b>Quotes</b> module - 
            see <a href="quotes.html">Quotes.</a> Either way, the screen below is displayed.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_01.PNG" style="width: 100%;">

      <ul>
          <li><b>Contract:</b> Select a contract no. from the drop down box.

                <li><b>Cost Plus Markup:</b> Creates an invoice from the entered costs 
                      (purchase orders, labour timesheets etc.) and transaction markups (on the defaults tab).</li>

                  If any other sales types were selected, the value field is protected.</li>
          <li><b>Project Manager:</b> Select a Project Manager from the drop down box.

          <li><b>Instructions:</b> Enter more detailed instructions about the job.
                  This may be more detailed than the short description.</li>

                  It should appear on the sales invoice.</li>  
      </ul>
      <p><b>N.B. Don't forget to keep saving your data - click the "Save" button - circled in red above at top right.</b></p> 
      <p>When you click <b>Save</b>, you may be presented with a screen as below. 
          This means that product invoice data lines are incomplete - if you proceed with Save, incomplete lines will not be saved.</p>

        <p><b>N.B. In practice, all the data on this screen will be initially created on the <a href="planner.html">Planner</a> module, 
        and then updated via the Mobile Manager module.</b></p>   
      <br>
      <p>You can then update <b>Default Transaction Markup</b> information (if necessary), 
          by clicking on the appropriate tab - circled in red below at top left. 
          This will open the following screen:
          <br> <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_03.PNG" style="width: 50%;">
      <p>This data is used if a job has a sales type of "Cost Plus Markup", for invoicing.

      <br> <br>
      <p>This screen is split in half:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><b>On the left:</b> A list of directories. These are created as each visit is created, and named after the job and engineer.
                These directories can be renamed or deleted, or a new directory can be created manually, 
                using the buttons at bottom left.</li>
        <li><b>On the right:</b> A list of attachments in the selected directory. 
                These may have been imported by the office for the engineer's use (e.g. a worksheet),
                or exported by the engineer from his mobile phone (e.g. a photo of work done).
                These attachments can be manipulated using the buttons underneath.</li>
