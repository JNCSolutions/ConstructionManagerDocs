      <h3 id="maintenance-jobs">Maintenance Jobs</h3>
      <p>To access Maintenance, select the Maintenance>Maintenance Jobs tab on the main menu. 
          This will open the following screen:</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_List_01.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>This displays a list of all maintenance jobs on your system. 
          The list can be manipulated in the usual way - see <a href="Manipulating Lists.html">Manipulating Lists.</a>.</p>
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="new-mjob"><b>New/Edit Maintenance Job</b></h4>
      <p>To create a new job, click on the <b>New</b> button. 
          This will open the following screen, under the details>job information tab.
          This data is used by the office, rather than the on-site engineer.</p>
      <p><b>N.B.</b> Jobs can also be created from the <b>Quotes</b> module - 
            see <a href="quotes.html">Quotes.</a> In that case, highlight a line and click on the <b>Edit</b> button.
            Either way, the screen below is displayed.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><b>Contract:</b> Select a contract no. from the drop down box. 
          Typically, you will create an "umbrella" contract no. for all small maintenance jobs,

          <li><b>Priority:</b> Select a priority from the drop down box. 
                  These codes can be setup in Construction Manager 50 (desktop version),

                  under Settings>Maintenance Settings>Auto Set Completion Dates.</li>
          <li><b>Status:</b> Select a status from the drop down box.</li>
          <li><b>Description:</b> Enter a short job description - this will appear on lists and reports.</li>
          <li><b>Sales type:</b> Select a sales type from the drop down box. The different types are as follows:</li>

                      Schedules can be imported from Excel in Construction Manager 50 (desktop version)

                <li><b>Cost Plus Markup:</b> Creates an invoice from the entered cost transactions 
                      (purchase orders, labour timesheets etc.) and applies an Mjob markup (on the defaults tab).</li>
              </ul>
          <li><b>M-job value:</b> You can only enter a value here if the sales type was selected as "Authorised Price".
                  If any other sales types were selected, the value field is protected 
                    and calculated from the data entered.</li>
          <li><b>Project Manager:</b> Select a Project Manager from the drop down box.
                  The project manager field is maintained in Construction Manager 50 (desktop version),

          <li><b>Customer/Branch Address:</b> Optionally, select an address from the drop down box.

                  This may be more detailed than the short description.</li>
          <li><b>Work Carried Out:</b> This data will be entered when the job is in progress or completed.
                  It is often used to show on the sales invoice.</li>

      <br> <br>
      
      <h4 id="edit-mjob"><b>Edit Maintenance Job</b></h4>
      <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_List_02.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <br>
      <p>To edit an existing job, select a job from the list and then click on the appropriate button - circled in red above. 
          This will open screens in identical format to those used 
          when <a href="#new-mjob">Creating a New Job.</a></p>
      <br>
      <h4><b>Delete Maintenance Job</b></h4>
      <p>To delete an existing job, select a job from the list and then click on the appropriate button - circled in red above. 
          You will be asked to confirm your selection. Warning â€“ you cannot retrieve a deleted Maintenance Job. 
          It is normally better to set the status to Cancelled.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4><b>Change Status</b></h4>
      <p>To change status on an existing job, select a job or range of jobs from the list 
            and then click on the <b>Change Status</b> button - circled in red above. 
            This will open screens as shown below.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Change_Status_03.PNG" style="width: 50%;">
      <br>
      <p>The following options are available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose a job or range of jobs - top radio button.</li>

        <li>Choose all jobs on the list, ignoring the filters - bottom radio button.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A second selection screen will then be displayed, where you can select the job status that you want your
             selected jobs to change to. Click <b>OK</b> or <b>Cancel</b>.</p>
      <br>
      <h4 id="transactions"><b>Job Costing Transactions</b></h4>
          <p>View <b>Transactions</b> relating to this M-job by clicking on the appropriate tabs - circled in red below. 
          This will open the following profit and loss screen for the selected job:
          <br> <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_05.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <br> <br>
      <p>Then click on the <b>Activity</b> tab - circled in red below.
          This will display the following screen:</p> 
          <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_06.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>This shows any transactions that have been entered, from a variety of sources. 
          In this case, we are seeing some labour, materials and purchase order activity, 
          that have been entered against the job.</p> 
      <br> <br>
      
      <h4 id="new-visit"><b>New Visits for Engineers</b></h4>
      <p>To allocate an engineer to a job, you need to select the <b>Visit Information Tab</b> 
          - circled in red below at top left. This will open the following screen:
          <br> <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_02.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>On this screen, you can perform the following functions:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Create visits from a drop down list of engineers.</li>
          <li>Create and update data about visits on the 4 tabs circled in red, top right.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><b>N.B. Visits</b> can also be created in the <a href="planner.html">Planner</a> module. 
                  The visit will then appear in the visit information tab. 
                  It should be created in one place or the other, but not both.</p>   
      <br>
      <h4 id="attachments"><b>Attachments</b></h4>
      <p>You can add <b>Attachments</b> by clicking on the appropriate tab - circled in red below at top left. 
          This will open the following screen:

      <img src="img/Maintenance_Attachments_01.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <br> <br>
      <p>This screen is split in half:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><b>On the left:</b> A list of directories is created by the software.
                These are created as each Mjob and visit is created, and named after the job and engineer.
                New or additional directories can be created, using the buttons at bottom left.</li>
        <li><b>On the right:</b> A list of attachments in the selected directory. 
                These may have been imported by the office for the engineer's use (e.g. a worksheet),
                or uploaded automatically from Mobile Manager (e.g. a photo or signature).
                These attachments can be manipulated using the buttons underneath.</li>
      </ul> <br>
         
      <h4><b>Notes</b></h4>
      <p>You can use <b>Notes</b> to record details or telephone calls about a job 
          by clicking on the appropriate tab - circled in red below at top left. This will open the following screen:
          <br> <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_04.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>Type a note in the main box, and then click the <b>Add Note</b> button - circled in red above at bottom right.
          Notes already entered are displayed under the note entry box.</p>     
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="invoice"><b>Invoice</b></h4>
      <p>Maintenance Invoices are created from the job record. There are settings which will determine which fields 
          from the Mjob are loaded into the invoice. These are found in Construction Manager 50 (desktop version) 
          in Settings>Defaults>Maintenance.
          There are 5 types of invoice that can be created. These are selected in the sales type.</p>
          <br> <br>
      
      <h4 id="authorized-price">Authorized Price</h4> 
      <p>This is used for a lump sum price invoice. Enter the value to be invoiced in the Mjob Value.
          Any field from the Mjob record can be printed on the invoice.
          Invoice <b>layout</b> design will be required to include the fields you require.
          We recommend that for this type of invoice you use the <b>work carried out</b> field for the invoice text 
          and this can be printed on the invoice.</p> 
          <p>Once the price and details have been entered, the invoice is generated by selecting the invoice button in the Mjob Record 
              or the Invoice button on the Maintenance Job List.</p>
          <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_02.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>This will then prepare data to be invoiced, and display as shown in the screen below:</p>   <br>   
       <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_03.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <br>
      <p>If you are happy to proceed, click on the <b>Save Invoices</b> button. This will display another prompt:</p> <br> 
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_06.PNG" style="width: 50%;">
       <p>Select an option as required to proceed. A further screen will be displayed, as below:</p>   <br> <br>  
       <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_07.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
       <p>This is the last stage of invoicing, where you select to <b>Post</b> to Sage - click on button circled in red, top right.
            Before you post, you can view the product lines, and can update customer information - tabs circled in red, top left.
            If you do update data, don't forget to save - click on button circled in red, top right. </p>
      
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="product-invoice">Product Invoice</h4> 
      <p>Select Sales Type = Product Invoice.  Then select Sales Tab and Product Invoice.  </p>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Product_Invoice_01.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>In the screen above, the invoice details can be entered as product items, line by line.</p> 
      <p><b>N.B. Don't forget to keep saving your data - click the "Save" button - circled in red above at top right.</b></p> 
      <p>When you click <b>Save</b>, you may be presented with a screen as below. 
         This means that product invoice data lines are incomplete - if you proceed with Save, incomplete lines will not be saved.</p>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Save_Warning_01.PNG" style="width: 50%;">  
      
      <br> <br> <br>
      <h4 id="quote-invoice">Quote Invoice</h4> 
      <p>This invoice type can only be used if you have the Quote module and have created the Mjob from a quote. </p>
      <p>In this case, the invoice type should already be set to quote invoice.
          Simply press the invoice button and a detailed invoice will be produced from the quote.</p> 
      
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="schedule-of-rates">Schedule of Rates</h4> 
      <p>To use this invoice type, you have to have set up <b>Schedule of Rates</b> first.</p>
      <p>Choose sales type = Schedule of Rates and save.
          To enter the schedule, go to Sales then select Schedule.
          In the screen below, you can build the invoice from the selected schedule.
          Once completed and saved, the invoice is produced in the same way as the other types.</p> 
          <img src="img/Maintenance_Schedule_Invoice_01.PNG" style="width: 100%;">  
       
      <br> <br> <br>
      <h4 id="cost-plus-mark-up">Cost plus Mark Up</h4> 
      <p>Before using this invoice type, you may want to update the <b>Default Transaction Markup</b> information for this job, 
          by clicking on the appropriate tab - circled in red below at top left. 
          This will open the following screen:  </p> 
          <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_03.PNG" style="width: 50%;">
      <p>The default values are stored in Construction Manager 50 (desktop), under Settings>Defaults>Maintenance.</p> 
      <p>Once the mark up values are correct, the invoice will be produced in the normal way.</p> 
      
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="group-invoice"><b>Invoice or Group Invoice</b></h4>
      <p>You can create individual or group invoices from the main maintenance jobs list - 
          select one of the tabs circled in red below. 
            This will open a standard selection box as shown below.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_01.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <br>

      <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_04.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <br>
      <p>You can see that two seperate invoices have been created, one for each Job.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you select "Group Invoice" M-jobs 10021 and 10022, the following screen will be displayed:</p>
      <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_05.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <br>
      <p>You can see that one combined invoice has been created, for two Jobs.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you are happy to proceed, click on the <b>Save Invoices</b> button. This will display another prompt:</p> <br> 
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_06.PNG" style="width: 50%;">
      <p>Select an option as required to proceed. A further screen will be displayed, as below:</p>   <br> <br>
