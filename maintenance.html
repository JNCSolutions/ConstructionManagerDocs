                These directories can be renamed or deleted, or a new directory can be created manually, 
                using the buttons at bottom left.</li>
        <li><b>On the right:</b> A list of attachments in the selected directory. 
                These may have been imported by the office for the engineer's use (e.g. a worksheet),

                These attachments can be manipulated using the buttons underneath.</li>
      </ul> <br>
         
      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p>You can use <b>Notes</b> to record details or telephone calls about a job

          Notes already entered are displayed under the note entry box.</p>     
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="invoice">Invoice</h4>
      <p>Maintenance Invoices are created from the job record. There are settings which will determine which fields 
          from the Mjob are loaded into the invoice. These are found in Construction Manager 50 (desktop version) 
          in Settings>Defaults>Maintenance.
          There are 5 types of invoice that can be created. These are selected in the sales type.</p>
          <br> <br>
      
      <h4 id="authorized-price">Authorized Price</h4> 
      <p>This is used for a lump sum price invoice. Enter the value to be invoiced in the Mjob Value.
          Any field from the Mjob record can be printed on the invoice.
          Invoice <b>layout</b> design will be required to include the fields you require.
          We recommend that for this type of invoice you use the <b>work carried out</b> field for the invoice text 
          and this can be printed on the invoice.</p> 
          <p>Once the price and details have been entered, the invoice is generated by selecting the invoice button in the Mjob Record 
              or the Invoice button on the Maintenance Job List.</p>
          <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Invoice_Select_02.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>This will then prepare data to be invoiced, and display as shown in the screen below:</p>   <br>

      <br>

      <p><b>N.B. Don't forget to keep saving your data - click the "Save" button - circled in red above at top right.</b></p> 
      <p>When you click <b>Save</b>, you may be presented with a screen as below.

      <img src="img/Maintenance_Save_Warning_01.PNG" style="width: 50%;">  
      
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="quote-invoice">Quote Invoice</h4> 
      <p>This invoice type can only be used if you have the Quote module and have created the Mjob from a quote. </p>

          Simply press the invoice button and a detailed invoice will be produced from the quote.</p> 
      
      <br> <br>
      <h4 id="schedule-of-rates">Schedule of Rates</h4>

          To enter the schedule, go to Sales then select Schedule.
          In the screen below, you can build the invoice from the selected schedule.
          Once completed and saved, the invoice is produced in the same way as the other types.</p>

          by clicking on the appropriate tab - circled in red below at top left. 
          This will open the following screen:  </p> 
          <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_03.PNG" style="width: 50%;">
      <p>The default values are stored in Construction Manager 50 (desktop), under Settings>Defaults>Maintenance.</p> 
      <p>Once the mark up values are correct, the invoice will be produced in the normal way.</p> 
      
      <h4 id="invoice">Invoice or Group Invoice</h4>
      <p>You can create individual or group invoices from the main maintenance jobs list -
