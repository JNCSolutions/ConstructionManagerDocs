    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
      <p>The Maintenance module has been designed to provide additional functionality for small maintenance types of work. 
      For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Producing job cards and instructions for workers, optionally via mobile phones</li>
        <li>Tracking job times and status of jobs</li>
        <li>Storing many site addresses which are used repeatedly</li>  
        <li>Different job types, e.g.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Authorised price</li>
          <li>Product invoice</li>
          <li>Quote invoice</li>
          <li>Cost plus markup</li>
          <li>Schedule of rates</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Automating sales invoicing, e.g.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Preview list of jobs to invoice</li>
          <li>One invoice per job</li>
          <li>Many jobs on one invoice</li>
        </ul
      </ul>
      </ul>
      <br>
      
      <h3 id="maintenance-jobs">Maintenance Jobs</h3>
      <p>To access Maintenance, select the Maintenance>Maintenance Jobs tab on the main menu.

      <h4 id="new-mjob">New Maintenance Job</h4>
      <p>To create a new job, click on the <b>New</b> button.

      <p><b>N.B.</b> Jobs are also often created from the <b>Quotes</b> module -

      <p>When you click <b>Save</b>, you may be presented with a screen as below.

      <p>You can then update <b>Default Transaction Markup</b> information (if necessary), 
          by clicking on the appropriate tab - circled in red below at top left. 
          This will open the following screen:
          <br> <br>
      <img src="img/Maintenance_Create_03.PNG" style="width: 50%;">
      <p>This data is used if a job has a sales type of "Cost Plus Markup", for invoicing.
          The default values are stored in (old) Construction Manager, under Settings>Defaults>Maintenance.</p>     
      <br>

      <br> <br>
      <p>This screen is split in half:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><b>On the left:</b> A list of directories. These are created as each visit is created, and named after the job and engineer.
                These directories can be renamed or deleted, or a new directory can be created manually, 
                using the buttons at bottom left.</li>
        <li><b>On the right:</b> A list of attachments in the selected directory. 
                These may have been imported by the office for the engineer's use (e.g. a worksheet),
                or exported by the engineer from his mobile phone (e.g. a photo of work done).
                These attachments can be manipulated using the buttons underneath.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      
    <p>View all <b>Transactions</b> relating to this M-job by clicking on the appropriate tab - circled in red below. 
          This will open the following screen:
          <br> <br>

      <br> <br>
      <p>This screen shows any transactions that have been entered, from a variety of sources.</p> 
      <p>In this case, we are seeing some labour activity, that has been entered as a timesheet, 
          via the <a href="maintenance-progress"> Maintenance Progress</a> function.</p>

          <br> <br>
