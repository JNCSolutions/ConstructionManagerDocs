      <br> <br>
    
    <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
      <p>There are 3 settings that need checking before Planner is implemented:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Waiting periods (see below in "Creating appointments") - 
              this is maintained in (old) Construction Manager under Settings > Defaults > Maintenance</li>
          <li>Working days and ties can be set in (old) Construction Manager in Settings > Defaults > Maintenance.</li>
          <li>Use Sage Payroll Employees - in (new) ConstuctionManager.Net under Settings > Connection settings.
              Check this if you want to include employees from Sage payroll.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>You can (optionally) add Custom Resources. 
        This would typically occur where a sub-contractor employs a number of labourers - 
        each of these could be set up as a resource and planned individually.
        Custom Resources will appear on the left, beneath Employees, Sub-contractors and Plant.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 id="month-week-day-view">Month, week, day view</h4>
        <p>You can elect to view the calendar either in Month, Week or Day view, using the appropriate tabs.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 id="filter-options">Filter Options</h4>
        <p>Use the Filter options tab to control the view options on contracts, employees, sub-contractors, plant, 
        custom resources and skills.</p>

        <p>You can use this feature to control the time scale - i.e. the size of display of days / weeks / months.
            This can be used in conjunction with the zoom featrure on your browser to aid visibility.</p>

        <h4 id="day-week-arrows">Day / Week arrows</h4>
        <p>You can use this feature to move the screen display forwards or backwards, by a week or day.</p>

        <br>    
        
    <h3 id="creating-editing-appointments">Creating and Editing Appointments</h3>

        <h4 id="create-edit">Create and Edit Appointments</h4>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Planner_Create_01.PNG" style="width: 50%;">

    <p>To create an appointment in, click in the row at the time the entry is to start, and then drag to where you want it to finish. 
        This then opens the 'Create New Appointment' window, where you can choose whether the entry relates to a contract (1) 
        or a maintenance job (2).</p>

    <p>1. If a <b>contract</b> is picked, just fill in the 'Instructions' box with the information that is wanted to appear in the entry. 
          Then click Save and the appointment will be generated in a purple box.</p>

    <p>2. If a <b>maintenance job</b> is picked, as well as filling out 'Instructions' for the appointment, a status must be set for it. 
          Also, a 'Visit Ref' is automatically generated when the appointment is saved.</p>

    <p>Maintenance job appointments are created in a green block, and having 'Waiting Periods'. 
        These are periods over which the appointment is due (during which the block turns amber).
        When the due period has passed, the block turns red. 
        The period can be set in the (old) Construction Manager program on your computer under 
        Settings > Defaults > Maintenance tab > Planner appointment due warn (hours).</p>

    <p>To edit the details in the appointment, simply double-click the appointment block and the 'Edit Appointment' window will appear.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 id="moving">Moving and Re-assigning Appointments</h4>
    <p>To change the time slot of the planner entry, you can either click and move either side of the block (which resizes the block), 
    or click the block in the middle and drag it to the correct time slot.</p>
    <p>To change the person that the appointment is assigned to, click the block and drag it onto the correct row. 
    You will then be asked if you want to change the visit reference number.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 id="copy-delete">Copy and Delete Appointments</h4>
    <p>To copy an entry, right-click on the entry and click 'copy'.
        You can then move the cursor to a new position, and left-click will create a new appointment.</p>
