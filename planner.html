      <p>To access the planner, click the 'Planner' button on the row of options along the top, in blue.

      <br> <br>
    
    <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
      <p>There are 3 settings that need checking before Planner is implemented:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Employees - in Settings > Connection settings. Check this if you use Sage Payroll employees.  
              If no employees are showing they will need setting up in Payroll or Construction Manager.  
              Support can advise / assist with this.</li>
          <li>Warning time periods (used with Maintenances Jobs and mobile manager) 
              (see below in <a href="#creating-editing-appointments">"Creating Appointments"</a>) 
              – go to Login > Settings > Defaults > Maintenance</li>
          <li>Working Period days and nights can be set in  Settings > Defaults > Maintenance. 
              This enables the night period and weekend to be hidden to allow more space on the planner screen.  
              The non-working period can be displayed by clicking  Options – Hide nightime / weekend hours. 
              Use Sage Payroll Employees - in (new) ConstuctionManager.Net under Settings > Connection settings.
              Check this if you want to include employees from Sage payroll.</li>
        </ul>
