    <h3>Account Settings</h3>

    <p>You can change your password by entering your current password, new password, and your new password once more to confirm.</p>

    <p>It is important that your password is unique, and complex enough to prevent guessing. Google has some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/kn/goodtoknow/online-safety/passwords/">good advice on picking a good password</a>.</p>

    <h3>Email Templates</h3>

    <p>Construction Manager makes it easy to send reports and invoices, individually or in bulk, to a large number of your clients and customers. Because it's important that your emails are properly presented, you can supply a set of templates to be used by the bulk mailer.</p>

    <p>To access the mail settings, click on the cog icon at the top right of Construction Manager, and select `Email Templates`.</p>

    <p>Simply enter your message body, default `to` and `cc` fields, and Construction Manager will handle the rest when it is time to send your mails.</p>

    <h4>To, CC and BCC</h4>

    <p>As well as `to` addresses, you can also specify addresses for `cc` or `bcc`. The `to` addresses can be selected from the recipient company's registered email addresses. The `cc` and `bcc` addresses can be filled in by hand.</p>

    <h4>Placeholders</h4>

    <p>You can add a personal touch to your email templates with our placeholders. If you want a value from your customer records to appear in your mail body, simply add one of these values to your template where you want it to appear:</p>

    
    <code><pre>%COMPANY_NAME%       The name of the recipient company
%CONTACT_NAME%       The name of the human listed as the company's main contact</pre></code>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <code><pre>Dear %CONTACT_NAME%,

Attached to this email is the invoice for our recently completed work.

Kind regards,
Joe Bloggs
