    <h3>Company Settings</h3>

    <p>The Company Settings tab allows you to manage company wide settings. You can use this tab to invite new users, manage the access rights of existing users and manage your outgoing mail address.</p>

    <p>If you would like outgoing mails from your account to come from a shared address, such as "enquiries@yourcompany.com", you must ask a member of the support team to enable this setting on your account. You will then be able to specify the email address from which all outgoing mail on your account will be set.</p>

    <h4>Changing Your Password</h4>

    <p>You can change your password by entering your current password, new password, and your new password once more to confirm.</p>
