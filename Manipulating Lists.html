    <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <br>

      <p>Lists are displayed in many places throughout Construction Manager, for selection and display of data.
          This section of Help Text explains how you can manipulate these lists so that only the desired data is displayed.
          As an example, we will be using a list of Quotes, but all lists will share the same attrributes.</p>

    <div id="selecting values" class="col-lg-12">
    <h3>Selecting Values</h3>
     <br>

        <br> <br>
        <p>Above every column on a list is one or, sometimes 2, entry boxes (circled in red, at top).
            You can key values, or partial values into these boxes, to select values from the column below. </p>
            <p>Some examples of this would include: </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Above the status column:</b>           Enter - "Open" to select quotes at "Open" status.</li>
        <li><b>Above the status column:</b>           Enter - "O" to select quotes at "Open" or "Ordered" status.</li>
        <li><b>Above the Date Created column:</b>     Enter - "21/03/2016" and "22/03/2016" to select quotes
                                                              created between those 2 dates.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In addition, <b>Filters</b> can be used in conjunction with Selecting Values. </p>
    <p>The user can use the filter button (circled in red, at bottom) to create or use a Filter.
        When data has been selected by entering a value at the top of a column, use the <b>Filter button</b> to
        save that Filter. Saved Filters can then be accessed and applied later.
        For instance, if the user had selected Quotes at Status Open, then he could save that filer and then 
        access it later from the drop-down box, and Apply it.</p>

        <br> <br>
        <p>The first column on the quotes list has an arrow next to the heading (circled in red):
          This indicates which way the data is displayed - in ascending or descending sequence.
          Click on it to reverse the sequence.</p>
