    <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <br>

      <p>Lists are displayed in many places throughout Construction Manager, for selection and display of data.
          This section of Help Text explains how you can manipulate these lists so that only the desired data is displayed.
          As an example, we will be using a list of Quotes, but all lists will share the same attrributes.</p>

    <h3> id="selecting values" Selecting Values</h3>
     <br>
        <img src="img/Quotes_List 02.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
        <br> <br>
        <p>Above every column on a list is one or, sometimes 2, entry boxes (circled in red, at top).
            You can key values, or partial values into these boxes, to select values from the column below. </p>
            <p>Some examples of this would include: </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Above the status column:</b>           Enter - "Open" to select quotes at "Open" status.</li>
        <li><b>Above the status column:</b>           Enter - "O" to select quotes at "Open" or "Ordered" status.</li>
        <li><b>Above the Date Created column:</b>     Enter - "21/03/2016" and "22/03/2016" to select quotes
                                                              created between those 2 dates.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In addition, <b>Filters</b> can be used in conjunction with Selecting Values. </p>
    <p>The user can use the filter button (circled in red, at bottom) to create or use a Filter.
        When data has been selected by entering a value at the top of a column, use the <b>Filter button</b> to
        save that Filter. Saved Filters can then be accessed and applied later.
        For instance, if the user had selected Quotes at Status Open, then he could save that filter, 
        access it later from the drop-down box, and Apply it.</p>

      <div id="sequencing data" class="col-lg-12">
    <h3>Sequencing Data</h3>
     <br>
        <img src="img/Quotes_List 03.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
        <br> <br>
        <p>The first column on the quotes list has an arrow next to the heading (circled in red):
          This indicates which way the data is displayed - in ascending or descending sequence.
          Click on it to reverse the sequence.</p>
           
      <br>      
      </div>
      
      <div id="selecting columns" class="col-lg-12">
    <h3>Selecting Columns</h3>
     <br>
        <img src="img/Quotes_List 04.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
        <br> <br>
        <p>In the bottom left-hand corner of the screen is a button labelled "Columns" (circled in red):
          Click on this to display the <b>Column Visibility</b> selection box.
          The user can then select or omit columns as desired.
          Additionally, the user can alter the <b>Rows per Page</b>.</p>
           
      <br>      
      </div>

<div id="downloading data" class="col-lg-12">
    <h3>Downloading Data to Excel and PDFs</h3>
     <br>
        <img src="img/Quotes_List 05.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
        <br> <br>
        <p>In the bottom left-hand corner of the screen are 2 buttons showing an Excel and Print icon (circled in red).
          These will download data to either an Excel file or a PDF print file - they work in an identical manner.</p>
        <p>Clicking on one of these buttons will display a box in the centre of the screen.
          The user can then either select the Current Selection option, will download all the highlighted rows, 
          <b>OR</b> select the All Rows option to download all data in the list.</p>
        <p>The downloaded file name will then be displayed in the bottom corner of the screen 
        in the normal Microsoft manner.</p>
