      <p>Before a quote is created, the user may wish to create a customer.
      This can be performed via 2 options under the <strong>Customer</strong> tab on the main menu.</p> 
      <p>The <strong>Sage Customers</strong> option creates customers in Sage, 
      while the <strong>Quote Customers</strong> option creates customers purely in the Quotes sub-system.</p>

    <h3>The Quotes List</h3>
     <br>

    <p>The quotes list displays all of your current quotes in a paginated, filterable list. From this list, you can:</p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new quote</li>
        <li>Edit existing quotes</li>
        <li>Delete quotes</li>
        <li>Print quotes</li>
        <li>Email quotes</li>
        <li>Export the list as a spreadsheet</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="the-quote-screen" class="col-lg-12">
    <br>
    <h3>The Quote Screen</h3>

    <p>The quote screen has five tabs: <strong>Details</strong>, <strong>Items</strong>, <strong>Terms</strong>, <strong>Analysis</strong> and <strong>Notes</strong>.</p>

    <h4 id="details-tab">Details</h4>

    <p>On the details tab, you control the information that you would normally associate with the quote header, such as the associated customer, contact details, address and date. You can also modify the <strong>header</strong> and <strong>description of works</strong> text.</p>
    <br>
      <img src="img/Quotes_Detail.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>The quote no. is auto-generated by the system.</p>
    <p>Other data to be entered includes:</p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Customer:</b>      Either enter an existing quote customer or a Sage customer. Both can be selected from drop-down lists.
                                  Additionally, both types of customer can be created at this stage.</li>
        <li>Branch:               Select a branch from the drop down box of branches associated with the selected customer.</li>
        <li>Header:               Enter a short description of the job.</li>
        <li>Secription of works:  Enter a longer, more detailed description of the job. This is a multi-line, free form text field.</li>
        <li>Footer:               Enter any text that you wish to display at the foot of the quote.</li>
        <li>Contact name:         This defaults to the contact name set up on the customer master file, but can be overwritten.</li>
        <li>Contact email:        This defaults to the contact email address set up on the customer master file, but can be overwritten.</li>
        <li>Contact tel:          This defaults to the contact telephone no. set up on the customer master file, but can be overwritten.</li>
        <li>Status:               A new quote will default to <b>Open</b>, but can be changed later to <b>Ordered</b>, <b>Lost</b> or <b>Inactive</b>.
                                  An open quote that is converted to an order, via the button at the top of the screen, 
                                  will be automatically changed to a status of <b>Ordered></b>. This field is used for reporting purposes.</li>
        <li>Date:                 This defaults to today's date but can be overwritten.</li>
        <li>Site address:         This defaults to the customer's address but can be overwritten.
                                  Pick an address from the drop down list, or create a new address.</li>
        
        
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
    
    
    
    <h4 id="items-tab">Items</h4>
     
    <p>The items tab contains the meat of the quote. Here you control the items that comprise the work itself. These items can either be inserted manually, or your sage products can be imported for use in constructionmanager.net.</p>
    <br>
      <img src="img/Quotes_Items.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
    <br>
    <h4 id="terms-tab">Terms</h4>

    <p>Terms are similar to Items, except they do not have costs associated with them. The terms tab simply gives you access to products that have been marked as text items. Terms can then be displayed separately from the items on your quote reports.</p>
    <br>
      <img src="img/Quotes_Terms.PNG" style="width: 100%;">
    <br>
    <h4 id="analysis-tab">Analysis</h4>

    <p>The analysis tab allows you to set the following values on a quote:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ref:</strong> A text reference for the quote.</li>
      <li><strong>Ex ref:</strong> A text reference for the quote.</li>
      <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Links to Construction Manager contracts to search for different types of job / work</li>
      <li><strong>Job analysis:</strong> Links to Construction Manager. It is a an additional analysis field with drop down selection.</li>
      <li><strong>Project manager:</strong> The person responsible for managing the project.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h4 id="notes-tab">Notes</h4>

    <p>The notes tab contains a list of timestamped and signed notes associated with a quote.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="ordering-a-quote" class="col-lg-12">
    <h3>Ordering a Quote</h3>

    <p>When a quote is ready for progression, it can be attached to a new or existing contract. When a quote is attached, the values from the quote are then transferred to the contract. If you wish to detact a quote from a contract, that must be done through the <a href="contracts.html">Contracts</a> page.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="invoicing-a-quote" class="col-lg-12">
    <h3>Invoicing a Quote</h3>

    <p>Once a quote has been attached to a contract, it can be invoiced. This will create an invoice record in CM50, and optionally, in Sage. Once a quote has been invoiced, it can no longer be re-assigned to a different contract.</p>
