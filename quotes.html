    <h3>The Quote Screen</h3>

    <p>The quote screen has five tabs: <strong>Details</strong>, <strong>Items</strong>, <strong>Terms</strong>, <strong>Analysis</strong> and <strong>Notes</strong>.</p>

    <h4 id="details-tab"><b>Details</b></h4>

    such as the customer, contact details, address and date. 
    You can also modify the header and description of works text.</p>

    <p>The <b>quote no.</b> is auto-generated by the system, or the user can select manual quote no.s in settings.</p>
    <p>Data to be entered includes:</p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Customer:</b>              Choose a Sage customer, if the customer is already in Sage, <b>OR</b>

                                          create a new quote customer using the "+" button.</li>
        <li><b>Branch:</b>                This allows additional contract details to be stored with a Customer Account.

                                          This will pick up the contact details from the branch address rather than the customer account address.</li>
        <li><b>Header: </b>               Enter a short description of the quote.

                                          but can be overwritten.</li>
        <li><b>Contact email:</b>         This defaults to the contact email address set up on the customer account record, 
                                          or branch address if selected, but can be overwritten.</li>
        <li><b>Contact tel:</b>           This defaults to the contact telephone no. set up on the customer account record, 
                                          or branch address if selected, but can be overwritten.</li>
        <li><b>Status:</b>                A new quote will default to <b>Open</b>, but can be changed later to <b>Ordered</b>, 
                                          <b>Lost</b> or <b>Inactive</b>.
                                          An open quote that is converted to an order, via the button at the top of the screen, 
                                          will be automatically changed to a status of Ordered. 
                                          This field is used for reporting purposes. 
                                          The status list can be edited in <a href="settings.html">Settings</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Date:</b>                  This defaults to today's date but can be overwritten.</li>
        <li><b>Site address:</b>          This defaults to the customer's address but can be overwritten. 
                                          Pick an address from the drop down list, or create a new address for where the work is to be carried out.</li>
